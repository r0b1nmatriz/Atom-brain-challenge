Create a Python web app on Replit using Flask and Hugging Face’s DistilGPT-2 to generate a viral quiz called “India’s Hardest Brain Challenge.” The app should:

1. **Homepage**:
   - Display a professional, mobile-friendly UI with text: “Take India’s Hardest Brain Challenge! Answer 10 toughest questions and get a chance to WIN an iPhone 16 Pro 512GB (completely free, no strings attached). Only the sharpest minds will conquer this quiz!”
   - Include a “Start Quiz” button and a subtle disclaimer: “Winners selected via lucky draw. Terms apply.”
   - Add Google AdSense banner ads above and below the quiz form (use placeholder code for now).
   - Use CSS for a clean, modern look (white background, bold orange buttons, Arial font).

2. **Quiz Logic**:
   - Generate 10 unique multiple-choice questions per user using DistilGPT-2. Questions should be challenging but fun, covering Indian trivia (e.g., “Which Indian city hosted the first IPL match?” or “What’s the chemical symbol for gold, named in ancient Indian texts?”).
   - Prompt for AI: “Generate 10 hard multiple-choice questions with 4 options each, based on Indian culture, history, science, and pop culture. Include correct answers.”
   - Store questions in Replit’s key-value database to avoid regenerating for the same session.
   - Collect user answers via a Flask form (radio buttons).

3. **Result Page**:
   - Show a score (e.g., “You got 8/10! You’re a Brain Champion!”) and a shareable result: “I scored 8/10 on India’s Hardest Brain Challenge! Can you beat me? Try now and win an iPhone 16 Pro 512GB!”
   - Use Pillow to overlay the result on a meme-style image (e.g., a trophy with Indian flag colors).
   - Include a “Share on WhatsApp” button linking to the app URL: “https://wa.me/?text=[result]%20at%20[repl-url].repl.co”.
   - Add a “Play Again” button to loop users, boosting ad impressions.
   - Display another AdSense ad below the result.

4. **Monetization**:
   - Integrate AdSense code (placeholder for now) in homepage and result page.
   - Optimize for 2–3 page views per user (homepage, quiz, result).
   - Target 10M–100M monthly users via viral sharing.

5. **Replit Optimization**:
   - Use DistilGPT-2 (~300MB) to fit within 500MB storage.
   - Store 5 meme templates (<100KB each) in `templates/` folder.
   - Cache AI-generated questions in Replit’s database to save CPU.
   - Limit AI calls to 1 per session (10 questions at once).
   - Serve static files (images, CSS) from `static/` folder.
   - Use Cloudflare’s free CDN if traffic spikes (integrates with Replit).

6. **Legit Appeal**:
   - Use professional text: “Test your brainpower with India’s toughest quiz! Join millions of players and enter our lucky draw for an iPhone 16 Pro 512GB. No purchase needed!”
   - Add a “Terms & Conditions” page (dummy text: “One winner monthly. Must be 18+. No cash alternative.”) to look legit.
   - Avoid scam vibes with clean design and subtle ad placement.

7. **Files**:
   - `main.py`: Flask app with DistilGPT-2 for question generation and Pillow for image creation.
   - `templates/index.html`: Homepage with quiz form.
   - `templates/result.html`: Result page with share button.
   - `static/style.css`: Mobile-friendly CSS.
   - `templates/trophy.png`: Sample meme image (add 4 more later).

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy on Replit’s free tier at a `*.repl.co` URL.
   - Use UptimeRobot (free) to ping every 5 minutes, keeping the app live.
   - Test on mobile (90% of Indian users).

Deliver the full code, including Flask routes, AI prompt, Pillow logic, HTML templates, and CSS. Ensure it runs on Replit’s free tier without crashing. Include instructions to add AdSense later.
